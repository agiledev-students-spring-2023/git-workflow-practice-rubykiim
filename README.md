## [ChatGPT writes code but won't replace developers](https://bit.ly/3Y2PQQV)
> This article discusses about potential impact of ChatGPT on software developers. Although ChatGPT might replace some aspects in coding since it already has proven its capability in writing simple web pages and applications. However, this could allow programmers to invest more time working on cybersecurity or complex architecture. It also mentions that the software is very likely to generate new types of jobs such as Promtpt Engineers or AI developers. As much as ChatGPT can benefit us, it can be a threat at some point as it will gradually mature to be able to build a complex application. However, I believe whether we can take advantage of this is also up to us--humans.

I completely agree with the role of developers could not be replaced by ChatGPT. From my personal experience, that software is highly based on rigorous logic and is sometimes detailed and comprehensive. However, humans would love to use shortcuts in programming (though sometimes lead to problems), which indicates our flexibility and creativity in thinking and frameworks. Its formality would hurt the conciseness and beauty of coding.
