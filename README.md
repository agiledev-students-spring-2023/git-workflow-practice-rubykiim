## [ChatGPT writes code but won't replace developers](https://bit.ly/3Y2PQQV)

> This article discusses about potential impact of ChatGPT on software developers. Although ChatGPT might replace some aspects in coding since it already has proven its capability in writing simple web pages and applications. However, this could allow programmers to invest more time working on cybersecurity or complex architecture. It also mentions that the software is very likely to generate new types of jobs such as Promtpt Engineers or AI developers. As much as ChatGPT can benefit us, it can be a threat at some point as it will gradually mature to be able to build a complex application. However, I believe whether we can take advantage of this is also up to us--humans.


### Comment (Brian Lee)

I agree that the emerging AI technologies such as ChatGPT perhaps signals a new future in the industry. While traditional software engineering roles may be replaced with different AI-based code generation, human verification of such code will always be needed in order to cross-checked. I personally believe the demand for software engineers would continue to rise but we must adapt to the skills that are needed in the market. 

### Comment

> It is no surprise that ChatGPT is the hottest issue in the tech industry. I found this article interesting because it addresses the impact of ChatGPT and also mentions how we use this advanced technology - whether to threat humans or to generate new jobs and benefit humans - is up to us.
